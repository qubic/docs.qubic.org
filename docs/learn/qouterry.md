## Quottery in a Nutshell

 - Scarcity Mechanism: Each bet burns 2% of the total QU used, further reducing the circulating supply and benefiting QU holders. 
 - First-Mover Advantage: Quottery stands as the first decentralised betting platform in the Qubic ecosystem, though it remains open for future competitors pending Quorum approval.

## Execution Fee

This fee is set by Computors and regulated by the Quorum, ensuring secure and fair bet processing. 

## Betting Service Fee

A 3% service fee applies to all winning bets, supporting the operation and maintenance of the platform. 

## Burning Fee

For every bet, 2% of the total amount staked in QU is burned, reducing the circulating supply and benefiting the ecosystem.

## Asset Transfer Fee
A fixed QU fee applies to asset transfers, ensuring minimal friction in moving assets between accounts. 

## Storage Fees
Bets and assets on Quottery require storage on the Qubic network. The smart contracts cover storage fees, ensuring users aren’t charged for network maintenance. 

## Looking Ahead

As Quottery continues to develop, additional features and betting options will be introduced, enhancing the user experience and ensuring a sustainable, decentralised ecosystem. Future updates will provide even more functionality, aiming to position Quottery as an essential part of the Qubic ecosystem.
