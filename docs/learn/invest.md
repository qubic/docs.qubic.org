## 2. Create a Qubic Wallet

Regardless of how you choose to invest, you'll need a Qubic wallet to store your QUs:

1. Create a seed: This is a 55-character lowercase string that acts as your password. For example: `lcehvbvddggkjfnokduyjuiyvkklrvrmsaozwbvjlzvgvfipqpnkkuf`

   :::caution
   Never share your seed with anyone. If you lose it, you lose your Qubic Units (QUs).
   :::

2. Get your Qubic ID: This is a 60-character string derived from your seed. You can obtain it by adding your seed to the [qubic.li wallet](https://wallet.qubic.li/).

3. Use the [qubic.li wallet](https://wallet.qubic.li/) to manage your QUs: Create a vault and add your seed to interact with Qubic.

   :::note
   This is an online wallet, so there are inherent risks. Always ensure you trust the platform you're using and understand the risks involved.
