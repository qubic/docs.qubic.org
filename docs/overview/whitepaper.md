# Whitepaper
Please find the current iteration of the whitepaper here: https://qubic.org/whitepaper


## Development Approach

Instead of releasing a whitepaper in the early stages, Qubic will only publish a whitepaper upon completion of its development. This approach ensures that all the information in the whitepaper will be accurate and up-to-date, avoiding the common pitfall of many projects whose actual development diverges from their initial whitepaper. In the meantime, our source code is considered a 'living' whitepaper as it has been completely open-source since day one, https://github.com/qubic/core.
